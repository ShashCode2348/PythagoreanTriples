# PythagoreanTriples
A short project in Python allowing you to create Pythagorean triples with just one given side
## What are Pythagorean Triples?
Pythagorean Triples are a set of 3 integers {a, b, c} that satisfy Pythagoras' Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2. This means that they can be the side lengths of a right angled tringle(in which the hypotenuse would be the longest side length, c).
